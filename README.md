# CORE-V X-Interface

The CORE-V X-Interface (core-v-xif) is a RISC-V eXtension interface that provides a generalized framework suitable to implement custom coprocessors and ISA extensions for existing RISC-V processors.

It features independent channels for accelerator-agnostic offloading of instructions and writeback of the result(s).
